This is a CHORD system. It is an example of Structured Peer-to-Peer architecture.

In this implementation, you can add, delete, lookup any physical/logical node if that exists in the CHORD.

As per instruction, initially there is one node in the CHORD (which is 0).

You can delete any physical node from the CHORD till there is at least one node left.

Following is the instruction for performing add/delete/lookup operations.
Let's start!
